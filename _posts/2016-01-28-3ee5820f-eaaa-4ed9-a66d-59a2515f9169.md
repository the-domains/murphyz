This seems to be quite a classic view of Rome...and though it didn't feel like I had seen this view many times before my trip there, I have certainly seen it crop up a lot in the past month. I guess it's always been popular, just not that recognisable to me before now.

Either way, St Peter's Basilica is certainly a wonderful building and, like St Paul's when in London, was something I found myself drawn to whenever I was out taking photos...attempting to get a glimpse of it or a nice composite with the dome in view.

For now you get a lovely sunset shot...the magnificent colours of which has been drowned out due to the use of long exposure...
