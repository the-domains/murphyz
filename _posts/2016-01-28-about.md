**About me**

This is the about me page, so...um...here's a horse or two.

They're Icelandic horses, so they generally have amazing 1980's rock-band haircuts.  Mostly.  This one had a haircut styled on Donald Trump. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fb62372-1e47-40a2-92fc-8b2a69ecf699.jpg)

...and here a picture of me...but in some sort of underground piping system.  It was moist down there.  What a horrible word that is...._moist_!

This one's a little foxier...here I am with a scruffy looking creature while walking in the High Tatra mountains in Slovakia.  I'm the one on the right - which you could have easily guessed because I'm holding a camera. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f1394e00-4eb0-4c98-88b1-fb34279774b1.jpg)

...I'm not sure what Mr Fox is looking at in this image...I imagine that after sniffing around my camera bag he is turning to a bear to confirm that there is nothing of interest to eat over here. That's a relief.

Well...not much else to say here really.  I hope that you are leaving here having learnt a lot about me...as the page title suggests.  In case you weren't paying attention:

* I have met a few horses 
* I have been in a tunnel
* I have met a fox
* I like photography
* Bonus fact: I'm from London, UK
